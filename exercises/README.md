# Exercises

## Task 01

Install G++ and Clang, then compile the provided file [`hello.cpp`](task01/hello.cpp).
Use the following flags when compiling:

    -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2

Next, set up [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) on your system and compile the provided file [`hello_boost.cpp`](task01/hello_boost.cpp).
Boost is quite common and provides you a set of useful C++ libraries.
Some of its content is even promoted into the C++ standard library.

## Task 02

Run Clang on the provided file [`vec.cpp`](task02/vec.cpp) using the following command:

    clang -std=c++17 -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only -Wno-vexing-parse vec.cpp

Clang will parse the input file and display its abstract syntax tree (AST).
In the bottom half of the output you'll find the function declaration of `main` followed by its `CompoundStmt`.
Take a close look at its children and compare the resulting AST with the input code.
Notice any oddities â€” something that looks counter intuitive?

As you can see, there are multiple different ways of initialisation in C++.
Check out the [corresponding section at cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization).

## Task 03

The directory [`task03`](task03) hosts four subdirectories, `libFoo`, `libBar`, `libBaz`, and `app`.

Each folder prefixed with `lib` represents a library and contains a header plus a source file.
Furthermore, the library `libBaz.so` depends on `libBar.so`.

`app` contains a single source file providing a `main` function.
It depends on all three libraries.

![Dependency Graph](images/task03_dependencies.png)

- Model this project structure using [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- Be sure to set the C++ standard to C++17 and enable warnings (`-Wall -Wextra`)
- The default build type should be *Release*

CMake itself is a build system generator.
You can choose from a variety of target build systems.
