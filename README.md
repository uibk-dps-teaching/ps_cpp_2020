## Grading

Throughout this course you have to complete 2 assignments.

- [Assignment 1](assignment1) has 9 points to score
- [Assignment 2](assignment2) has 11 points to score
- You need at least 13 points to pass this course

Points will be subtracted for shortcomings discovered during evaluation.
This includes things like:

- Executables *segfaulting*
- Unnecessary waste of time or space (memory leaks)
- â€¦

Attendance is not required for this course.

## Exercises

While the previous iterations of this course leveraged weekly exercise sheets, this one does not.
However, I would like to keep these exercises around as they support the lecture and explore certain auxiliary topics relevant to C++.
You are encouraged to solve (or at least think about) these exercises and participate in the discussions during the stream.
You will not submit a solution as these exercises are optional, but feel free to ask questions when running into problems.

The [`exercises`](exercises) folder will be updated throughout the semester.
